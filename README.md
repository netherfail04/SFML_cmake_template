# SFML_cmake_template
A simple SFML template using cmake. All you have to do is run "cmake ."

As the above states, this is a simple template for SFML using cmake on linux. 

<h1> Compiling </h1>

It requires SFML to be installed. To install SFML on Ubuntu or Debain, use:

sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

To get CMake, do:

```sudo apt-get install cmake```

Once unzipped or cloned, do:

```cmake .```

This will generate a Makefile, which can be used to compile the source code that will end up in ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/bin

Execute using:

```./Game```

This is my first github repository, and first project with CMake/Make, so please let me know if I screwed something up in this description or if I'm just a reetus doing things completely wrong.
